HashMap vs HashSet:

HashSet is based on HashMap.
HashSet is used for unique sets of elements.

In a map you store key-value pairs
In a set you only store the keys.

Both:
- No duplicates
- Not ordered
- Constant time add/get

------------------------
Hash maps are implemented with both a key and a value. They are a pair and are unique. Internally, they are in an array with a set size. The get method uses a key as the parameter and returns the corresponding value.

------------------------
*The class following the colon is the faster of the two

Put: HASHMAP
Get: TREEMAP
------------------------
Built in heap is the PriorityQueue
